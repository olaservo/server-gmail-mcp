# Gmail AutoAuth MCP Server (`@olaservo` fork)

> **This is `@olaservo/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp`** — a fork of
> [`lowrykun/server-gmail-mcp`](https://github.com/lowrykun/server-gmail-mcp) (itself a fork of the
> archived `@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp`). It adds two things on top:
>
> 1. **Cross-account reply threading.** Replies now thread correctly in the *recipient's* mailbox,
>    not just the sender's. When you reply with a `threadId`, the server resolves the parent's real
>    RFC2822 `Message-ID` from the thread and writes proper `In-Reply-To`/`References` headers (the
>    Gmail per-mailbox `threadId` alone doesn't thread across accounts). `read_email` now also
>    surfaces `Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To` and `References`, and `send_email`/`draft_email` accept an
>    explicit `messageIdHeader` to override auto-resolution.
> 2. **Read allowlist (fail-closed).** Read/search tools only ever return mail from trusted senders,
>    guarding against ingesting untrusted/adversarial email (a prompt-injection surface) when
>    triaging an inbox. See [Read allowlist](#read-allowlist-trusted-senders-only) below.
> 3. **Read-only by default.** The server exposes only read-only tools unless you set
>    `GMAIL_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true`. Send/draft/reply/delete/modify and label/filter management are
>    hidden until opted in. See [Read-only by default](#read-only-by-default) below.
> 4. **MCP TypeScript SDK v2 / protocol revision 2026-07-28.** The tool server serves both protocol
>    eras from one binary. See [MCP protocol support](#mcp-protocol-support) below.

## MCP protocol support

The tool server is built on the [MCP TypeScript SDK v2](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) (`@modelcontextprotocol/server`) and serves **both protocol eras over stdio from a single process**, via the SDK's `serveStdio` entrypoint:

| Client opens with | Negotiated revision |
| --- | --- |
| A per-request `_meta` envelope naming a modern revision (or a `server/discover` probe) | `2026-07-28` |
| The classic `initialize` handshake | `2025-11-25` (or whatever the client offers) |

The era is pinned once per connection, from the opening exchange — nothing needs configuring, and older hosts keep working unchanged.

Two consequences of the SDK upgrade worth knowing:

- **Node.js 20+ is required** (was 14+), and **zod 4.2+** replaces zod 3 (`zod-to-json-schema` is gone — zod 4 emits draft-2020-12 JSON Schema natively).
- **`gmail-channel` (`src/channel.ts`) stays on the 2025-era wiring.** Claude Code's experimental channel protocol needs an `initialize` handshake to negotiate `capabilities.experimental['claude/channel']` and pushes unsolicited server→client notifications — neither exists in 2026-07-28, which replaces push notifications with client-driven `subscriptions/listen`. The channel entrypoint is on SDK v2 but deliberately serves only the 2025 era.

## Read allowlist (trusted senders only)

An app-level policy (independent of OAuth scope) that restricts the **read** tools — `read_email`,
`search_emails`, `download_email`, `download_attachment`, `get_thread`, `list_inbox_threads`,
`get_inbox_with_threads` — so they only ever surface mail whose sender is on a per-account trusted
list. Send/draft/label/filter tools are unaffected.

- **Fails closed:** if no allowlist is configured, *all* reads are blocked with a message telling you
  to populate it. Set it deliberately.
- **Self is always trusted:** the account's own address (from the Gmail profile) is added
  automatically, so your own sent messages in a thread are never filtered out.
- **Matching:** exact address (`alice@example.com`) or whole domain (`@example.com` /
  `example.com`), case-insensitive.

Configure via either or both (merged):

- **Env** `GMAIL_READ_ALLOWLIST` — comma/semicolon/whitespace separated, e.g.
  `GMAIL_READ_ALLOWLIST="alice@example.com, @trusted.org"`.
- **JSON file** `GMAIL_ALLOWLIST_PATH`, or, if unset, auto-derived from the credentials path
  (`credentials-johnny.json` → `allowlist-johnny.json` in the same directory). Array or object form:

  ```json
  { "addresses": ["alice@example.com"], "domains": ["trusted.org"] }
  ```
  ```json
  ["alice@example.com", "@trusted.org"]
  ```

`search_emails` injects a `from:(…)` clause into the Gmail query *and* post-filters results, so
nothing off-list can be returned even if the query is crafted to bypass it. Thread/inbox tools omit
off-list messages and report a `withheldCount`.

## Read-only by default

By default the server exposes **only read-only tools**. The write tools — `send_email`,
`draft_email`, `reply_all`, `modify_email`, `delete_email`, `batch_modify_emails`,
`batch_delete_emails`, `create_label`, `update_label`, `delete_label`, `get_or_create_label`,
`create_filter`, `delete_filter`, `create_filter_from_template` — are hidden from `tools/list`
and refused if called directly.

- **Enable writes:** set `GMAIL_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true` (also accepts `1` / `yes`). Restart the
  server for the change to take effect.
- **Independent of OAuth scope.** This gate is layered *on top of* the scope filter, so it works
  with existing credentials — no re-authentication needed. (Write tools still require the matching
  OAuth scope to actually run; see [OAuth Scopes](#oauth-scopes) below.)
- The read tools that remain available are still subject to the fail-closed read allowlist above.
  Note that `list_email_labels`, `list_filters`, and `get_filter` are read-only and therefore stay
  available by default.

# Gmail AutoAuth MCP Server (upstream notes)

[![CI](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> **This is an actively maintained fork of [GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server](https://github.com/GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server).**
>
> The original repository has been unmaintained since August 2025 — 7+ months with zero maintainer activity and 72+ unmerged pull requests. I use this MCP server daily as part of my Claude Code workflow and depend on it working correctly, so I picked it up.
>
> **Pull requests are welcome.** If you've been sitting on fixes or features with nowhere to submit them, this is the place.

### What this fork adds

- **Fixed reply threading** — auto-resolves `In-Reply-To` and `References` headers so email replies land in the correct thread instead of creating orphaned messages ([upstream PR #91](https://github.com/GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server/pull/91), still pending)
- **Send-as alias support** — optional `from` parameter for multi-identity email management (send from any configured Gmail alias)
- **Reply-all tool** — `reply_all` automatically fetches the original email, builds To/CC recipient lists (excluding yourself), and sets proper threading headers ([PR #3](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server/pull/3) by [@MaxGhenis](https://github.com/MaxGhenis))
- **Fixed `list_filters`** — was returning empty array due to wrong response property name ([PR #4](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server/pull/4) by [@nicholas-anthony-ai](https://github.com/nicholas-anthony-ai))
- **Custom OAuth2 scoping** — `--scopes` flag to request only the permissions you need, with automatic tool filtering ([PR #6](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server/pull/6) by [@tansanDOTeth](https://github.com/tansanDOTeth))
- **CI/CD hardening** — fixed shell injection vector in GitHub Actions workflow, added least-privilege permissions scope ([PR #9](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server/pull/9) by [@JF10R](https://github.com/JF10R))
- **Security hardening** — fixed path traversal in attachment download, restricted OAuth credential file permissions ([PR #10](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server/pull/10) by [@JF10R](https://github.com/JF10R))
- **Dependency security** — upgraded MCP SDK to v1.27.1 (3 CVE fixes), upgraded nodemailer (DoS + routing fix), moved dev-only packages out of production deps ([PR #11](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server/pull/11) by [@JF10R](https://github.com/JF10R))
- **Thread-level tools** — `get_thread`, `list_inbox_threads`, `get_inbox_with_threads` for efficient thread-based email reading in a single call
- **Tool annotations** — MCP spec annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`) on all tools for safer LLM tool execution ([PR #14](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server/pull/14) by [@bryankthompson](https://github.com/bryankthompson))
- **Download email tool** — `download_email` saves emails to disk in json/eml/txt/html formats without consuming LLM context ([PR #13](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server/pull/13) by [@icanhasjonas](https://github.com/icanhasjonas))

All features are production-tested in daily use.

## Installation & Authentication

### Installing Manually
1. Create a Google Cloud Project and obtain credentials:

   a. Create a Google Cloud Project:
      - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
      - Create a new project or select an existing one
      - Enable the Gmail API for your project

   b. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:
      - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
      - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
      - Choose either "Desktop app" or "Web application" as application type
      - Give it a name and click "Create"
      - For Web application, add `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback` to the authorized redirect URIs
      - Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys
      - Rename the key file to `gcp-oauth.keys.json`

2. Run Authentication:

   You can authenticate in two ways:

   a. Global Authentication (Recommended):
   ```bash
   # First time: Place gcp-oauth.keys.json in your home directory's .gmail-mcp folder
   mkdir -p ~/.gmail-mcp
   mv gcp-oauth.keys.json ~/.gmail-mcp/

   # Run authentication from anywhere
   npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth
   ```

   b. Local Authentication:
   ```bash
   # Place gcp-oauth.keys.json in your current directory
   # The file will be automatically copied to global config
   npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth
   ```

   The authentication process will:
   - Look for `gcp-oauth.keys.json` in the current directory or `~/.gmail-mcp/`
   - If found in current directory, copy it to `~/.gmail-mcp/`
   - Open your default browser for Google authentication
   - Save credentials as `~/.gmail-mcp/credentials.json`

   > **Note**: 
   > - After successful authentication, credentials are stored globally in `~/.gmail-mcp/` and can be used from any directory
   > - Both Desktop app and Web application credentials are supported
   > - For Web application credentials, make sure to add `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback` to your authorized redirect URIs

3. Configure in Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Support

If you prefer using Docker:

1. Authentication:
```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/gcp-oauth.keys.json,target=/gcp-oauth.keys.json \
  -v mcp-gmail:/gmail-server \
  -e GMAIL_OAUTH_PATH=/gcp-oauth.keys.json \
  -e "GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/gmail-server/credentials.json" \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  mcp/gmail auth
```

2. Usage:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v",
        "mcp-gmail:/gmail-server",
        "-e",
        "GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/gmail-server/credentials.json",
        "mcp/gmail"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cloud Server Authentication

For cloud server environments (like n8n), you can specify a custom callback URL during authentication:

```bash
npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth https://gmail.gongrzhe.com/oauth2callback
```

#### Setup Instructions for Cloud Environment

1. **Configure Reverse Proxy:**
   - Set up your n8n container to expose a port for authentication
   - Configure a reverse proxy to forward traffic from your domain (e.g., `gmail.gongrzhe.com`) to this port

2. **DNS Configuration:**
   - Add an A record in your DNS settings to resolve your domain to your cloud server's IP address

3. **Google Cloud Platform Setup:**
   - In your Google Cloud Console, add your custom domain callback URL (e.g., `https://gmail.gongrzhe.com/oauth2callback`) to the authorized redirect URIs list

4. **Run Authentication:**
   ```bash
   npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth https://gmail.gongrzhe.com/oauth2callback
   ```

5. **Configure in your application:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "gmail": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

This approach allows authentication flows to work properly in environments where localhost isn't accessible, such as containerized applications or cloud servers.

## OAuth Scopes

You can limit the server's Gmail access by specifying OAuth scopes during authentication. This controls which tools are available to the LLM, reducing the attack surface for sensitive operations.

### Available Scopes

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `gmail.readonly` | Read-only access to emails (search, read, download attachments) |
| `gmail.modify` | Full read/write access to emails (superset of `readonly` - includes sending, modifying, deleting) |
| `gmail.compose` | Create drafts and send emails only |
| `gmail.send` | Send emails only |
| `gmail.labels` | Manage labels only |
| `gmail.settings.basic` | Manage filters and settings |

> **Note**: `gmail.modify` is a superset that includes all read capabilities. You don't need `gmail.readonly` if you have `gmail.modify`.

### Authenticating with Specific Scopes

Use the `--scopes` flag to request only the permissions you need:

```bash
# Read-only access (recommended for safe browsing)
npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth --scopes=gmail.readonly

# Read-only with filter management
npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth --scopes=gmail.readonly,gmail.settings.basic

# Full access (default behavior)
npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth --scopes=gmail.modify,gmail.settings.basic
```

If no `--scopes` flag is provided, the server defaults to `gmail.modify,gmail.settings.basic` for full functionality.

> **Note**: OAuth scopes are not the only gate. Even with write scopes granted, write tools stay
> hidden until you set `GMAIL_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true` — see [Read-only by default](#read-only-by-default).

### Scope-to-Tool Mapping

The server automatically filters available tools based on your authorized scopes:

| Tools | Required Scope (any) |
|-------|---------------------|
| `read_email`, `search_emails`, `download_attachment` | `gmail.readonly` or `gmail.modify` |
| `list_email_labels` | `gmail.readonly`, `gmail.modify`, or `gmail.labels` |
| `send_email`, `draft_email`, `reply_all` | `gmail.modify`, `gmail.compose`, or `gmail.send` |
| `modify_email`, `delete_email`, `batch_modify_emails`, `batch_delete_emails` | `gmail.modify` |
| `create_label`, `update_label`, `delete_label`, `get_or_create_label` | `gmail.modify` or `gmail.labels` |
| `list_filters`, `get_filter`, `create_filter`, `delete_filter`, `create_filter_from_template` | `gmail.settings.basic` |

### Re-authenticating

To change your scopes, simply run the auth command again with different scopes. This will replace your existing credentials.

## Claude Code CLI Configuration

To use this MCP server with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), add it to your MCP settings.

### Read-Only Configuration (Recommended for Safe Browsing)

First, authenticate with read-only scope:

```bash
npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth --scopes=gmail.readonly
```

Then add to your Claude Code MCP settings (`~/.claude/mcp_settings.json` or project-level `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

With read-only scopes, only these read-only tools are available to Claude:
- `read_email` - Read email content
- `search_emails` - Search your inbox
- `download_attachment` - Download attachments
- `download_email` - Download an email to a file
- `get_thread` - Read a full thread
- `list_inbox_threads` - List threads
- `get_inbox_with_threads` - List threads with full message bodies
- `list_email_labels` - List available labels

(This is also the default tool set for *any* scope when `GMAIL_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS` is not set.)

### Full Access Configuration

For full Gmail management capabilities, authenticate with write scopes **and** set
`GMAIL_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true` (write tools are hidden by default):

```bash
npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth --scopes=gmail.modify,gmail.settings.basic
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GMAIL_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This enables all tools including sending emails, managing labels, creating filters, reply-all, and
batch operations. Without `GMAIL_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true`, only the read-only tools are exposed even
with `gmail.modify` granted.

## Available Tools

The server provides the following tools that can be used through Claude Desktop:

### 1. Send Email (`send_email`)

Sends a new email immediately. Supports plain text, HTML, or multipart emails **with optional file attachments**.

Basic Email:

Replies to all recipients of an email. Automatically fetches the original email to build the recipient list and sets proper threading headers (`In-Reply-To`, `References`, `threadId`).

**How it works:**
1. Fetches the original email by `messageId`
2. Builds **To** from the original sender (From header)
3. Builds **CC** from original To + CC, excluding your own email
4. Sets threading headers so the reply lands in the correct thread
5. Sends via the existing `send_email` pipeline (supports attachments, HTML, multipart)

```json
{
  "messageId": "182ab45cd67ef",
  "body": "Thanks for the update, everyone. I'll review and get back to you.",
  "mimeType": "text/plain"
}
```

**With HTML and attachments:**
```json
{
  "messageId": "182ab45cd67ef",
  "body": "Plain text fallback",
  "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the update. See attached notes.</p>",
  "mimeType": "multipart/alternative",
  "attachments": ["/path/to/notes.pdf"]
}
```

Parameters:
- `messageId` (required): ID of the email to reply to
- `body` (required): Reply body (plain text, or fallback when using multipart)
- `htmlBody` (optional): HTML version of the reply body
- `mimeType` (optional): `text/plain` (default), `text/html`, or `multipart/alternative`
- `attachments` (optional): Array of file paths to attach

## Advanced Search Syntax

The `search_emails` tool supports Gmail's powerful search operators:

| Operator | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `from:` | `from:john@example.com` | Emails from a specific sender |
| `to:` | `to:mary@example.com` | Emails sent to a specific recipient |
| `subject:` | `subject:"meeting notes"` | Emails with specific text in the subject |
| `has:attachment` | `has:attachment` | Emails with attachments |
| `after:` | `after:2024/01/01` | Emails received after a date |
| `before:` | `before:2024/02/01` | Emails received before a date |
| `is:` | `is:unread` | Emails with a specific state |
| `label:` | `label:work` | Emails with a specific label |

You can combine multiple operators: `from:john@example.com after:2024/01/01 has:attachment`

## Advanced Features

### **Email Attachment Support**

The server provides comprehensive attachment functionality:

- **Sending Attachments**: Include file paths in the `attachments` array when sending or drafting emails
- **Attachment Detection**: Automatically detects MIME types and file sizes
- **Download Capability**: Download any email attachment to your local filesystem
- **Enhanced Display**: View detailed attachment information including filenames, types, sizes, and download IDs
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for all common file types (documents, images, archives, etc.)
- **RFC822 Compliance**: Uses Nodemailer for proper MIME message formatting

**Supported File Types**: All standard file types including PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, images (PNG, JPG, GIF), archives (ZIP, RAR), and more.

### Email Content Extraction

The server intelligently extracts email content from complex MIME structures:

- Prioritizes plain text content when available
- Falls back to HTML content if plain text is not available
- Handles multi-part MIME messages with nested parts
- **Processes attachments information (filename, type, size, download ID)**
- Preserves original email headers (From, To, Subject, Date)

### International Character Support

The server fully supports non-ASCII characters in email subjects and content, including:
- Turkish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other non-Latin alphabets
- Special characters and symbols
- Proper encoding ensures correct display in email clients

### Comprehensive Label Management

The server provides a complete set of tools for managing Gmail labels:

- **Create Labels**: Create new labels with customizable visibility settings
- **Update Labels**: Rename labels or change their visibility settings
- **Delete Labels**: Remove user-created labels (system labels are protected)
- **Find or Create**: Get a label by name or automatically create it if not found
- **List All Labels**: View all system and user labels with detailed information
- **Label Visibility Options**: Control how labels appear in message and label lists

Label visibility settings include:
- `messageListVisibility`: Controls whether the label appears in the message list (`show` or `hide`)
- `labelListVisibility`: Controls how the label appears in the label list (`labelShow`, `labelShowIfUnread`, or `labelHide`)

These label management features enable sophisticated organization of emails directly through Claude, without needing to switch to the Gmail interface.

### Batch Operations

The server includes efficient batch processing capabilities:

- Process up to 50 emails at once (configurable batch size)
- Automatic chunking of large email sets to avoid API limits
- Detailed success/failure reporting for each operation
- Graceful error handling with individual retries
- Perfect for bulk inbox management and organization tasks

## Security Notes

- OAuth credentials are stored securely in your local environment (`~/.gmail-mcp/`)
- The server uses offline access to maintain persistent authentication
- Never share or commit your credentials to version control
- Regularly review and revoke unused access in your Google Account settings
- Credentials are stored globally but are only accessible by the current user
- **Attachment files are processed locally and never stored permanently by the server**

## Troubleshooting

1. **OAuth Keys Not Found**
   - Make sure `gcp-oauth.keys.json` is in either your current directory or `~/.gmail-mcp/`
   - Check file permissions

2. **Invalid Credentials Format**
   - Ensure your OAuth keys file contains either `web` or `installed` credentials
   - For web applications, verify the redirect URI is correctly configured

3. **Port Already in Use**
   - If port 3000 is already in use, please free it up before running authentication
   - You can find and stop the process using that port

4. **Batch Operation Failures**
   - If batch operations fail, they automatically retry individual items
   - Check the detailed error messages for specific failures
   - Consider reducing the batch size if you encounter rate limiting

5. **Attachment Issues**
   - **File Not Found**: Ensure attachment file paths are correct and accessible
   - **Permission Errors**: Check that the server has read access to attachment files
   - **Size Limits**: Gmail has a 25MB attachment size limit per email
   - **Download Failures**: Verify you have write permissions to the download directory

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

**CI requires README updates** — every push to `main` and every PR must include a README.md change (even a version bump or changelog entry). This ensures documentation stays current as the codebase evolves.

To bypass for commits that genuinely don't need a docs update (dependency bumps, CI config changes), include `[skip-readme]` or `[no-readme]` in your commit message or PR title.


## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

> The `mcp-evals` scoring harness that used to live in `src/evals` was removed in v3.0.0: it still pins the v1 MCP SDK and zod 3, which cannot coexist with the zod 4 floor that SDK v2 requires.
